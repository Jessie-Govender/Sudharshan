I promised God I wouldn't ask him for anything this year, but today I make an exception. <br>

  <p>
    <span class="White">I pray you get everything you're working so damn hard for. I hope every obstacle, every difficulty, every pain is erased from your life. </span> I hope every sacrifice, every difficulty, and every struggle pays you triple fold back.</p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;You're the best thing that ever happened to me Sudharshan, and I'll never forgive myself for losing that.</span>;
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; No one is more grateful for this day than me.
    </span>;

    `Happy Birthday ❤️
    <br><br>
    You’re smart, kind, annoying in the best way,
    and somehow still my favorite bug in the system.
    <br><br>
    I hope this year brings you clean code,
    solved problems,
    and me right next to you for all of it.
